/*

Write a function that gets two arrays of ints of length n and copies all data from one array into the other. For example:

int arr1[5] = {-1, 0, 2, -2, 4};

int arr2[5];

array_copy(arr2, arr1, 5);

//arr2 will also have values -1, 0, 2, -2, 4 and arr2[0] = 10 will not change the content of arr1 (i.e., deep-copy)
