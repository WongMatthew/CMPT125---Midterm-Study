/*
There are two methods to convert from decimal to binary

METHOD 2: Division

For example, our key is 75

STEP 1: Divide your key by 2 until it reaches 0 and record the remainders
75 / 2 = 37 R1
37 / 2 = 18 R1
18 / 2 = 9  R0
9  / 2 = 4  R1
4  / 2 = 2  R0
2  / 2 = 1  R0
1  / 2 = 0  R1

STEP 2: Record the remainders backwards to receive the binary value

1 0 0 1 0 1 1       <-- This is our answer
