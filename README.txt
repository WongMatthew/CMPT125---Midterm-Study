This file is not an open study resource.

It may contain errors, it is solely for the author (me) to understand how stuff works.

Under the MISC folders, you will find midterm attempts. Ignore that. 
That is me attempting to do the previous midterms :D 
If you got access to this resource from me or someone else, you should attempt the practices on your own.

Cool. Ok bye!
